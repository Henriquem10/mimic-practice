practicing some machine learning techiniques using the mimic-III database. Tried using gradient boosting, random forest and logistic regression on python to find out if a pacient has sepsis. Used the SOFA score as the gold standart.
The dataset used was an csv file that I made using google Query. I can't post them here.
